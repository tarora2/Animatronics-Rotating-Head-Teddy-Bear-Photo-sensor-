A rotating head teddy bear. Made using an Arduino and an Motor Drive Controller Board Module Dual H Bridge DC Stepper. 
It uses a photo sensor. So when the sensor detects the light the head of the bear is rotated partially on both the sides.
Along with that, every time the head is rotated and LED, in the eyes of the bear, turns on.
